I was totally not paying attention then. I was wondering why not people had answered. Anyways, I am doing them now. :P\n\n**1.  What were the goals of the Spanish ( individually and as a nation) \nin establishing an empire in the Americas?**\n\nThe goals of the Spanish were to win land and people for the Catholic church. They wanted to control Central and South America to build up their empire and increase their world affairs.

    "text": "\nHow does internal tension in the Native American empires of the Americas aid Spanish attempts to create their empire?\n\nSmall pox took out a lot of Native Americans during this time which weakened their empires drastically. The Incan empire was invaded with this disease which made it easier for Francisco Pizzaro to come in and seize the capital city. “But like the Aztecs, unrest between the Incas and conquered groups created tensions and left the empire vulnerable to foreigners. Smallpox spread in advance of Spanish conquerors and hit the Incan empire in 1525. Epidemics ravaged the population, cutting the empire’s population in half, killing the Incan emperor Huayna Capac and many members of his family and sparking a bloody war of succession.” With all of that happening, Francisco Pizzaro was able to deceive the Inca rulers and take control.\nWhat racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World? Why is it established and how does it operate?\n\nA racial hierarchy was marked in the New World in the mid-1600’s called Sistema de Castas. This system organized individuals into a variety of racial groups based on their “purity of blood.” It became almost prerequisites for social and political advancement in Spanish colonial society. Iberian-born Spaniards were at the highest level of administration and had the greatest estates. Below them are their descendants, which are New World-born Spaniards. Following them are the Mestizos, who were mixed Spanish and Indian heritage. \n",

This aided the Spanish by allowing them to enlist these native allies to fight and overthrow the empires.\n\n**What racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World?**\nThe Spanish established a racial system called the Sistema de Castas.  Rooted in medieval practices, this classified people into various racial groups based upon their supposed “purity of blood.” \n\n**Why is it established and how does it operate?**\nIt was established to rank people social and political advancement in Spanish colonial society.  It provided an excuse to empower Spaniards by their definition of superiority.\nThe blood line ranking was dominated first by the Iberian-born Spaniards known as the Peninulares or Espanoles. These individuals held the highest administration positions and estates.  The descendants, called Criollos, were next in line for opportunities.  Then the mixed Spanish and Indians were considered the lowest on the scale.",

This was so because they didn't have a strong, united standing with one another, making it possible for Europeans to gain allies, take over smaller towns, and eventually the remainder of the Central and Southern Americas. \n\n**What racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World? Why is it established and how does it operate?**\nThe racial system established by the Spanish in the New World was formed so that Spaniards born in Spain were at the top social status, followed by Spaniards born in New Spain, then those of Spanish and Native American descent, and last Native Americans and slaves. The Spanish believed the more \"pure\" your blood, the higher your status. This was established to form a social structure and provide a \"prerequisite for social and political advancement\", as mentioned in the text. ",

Small pox spread through contact, influenza and measles were spread as well. Crops and animals were exchanged between the new and old worlds. Corn, potatoes, beans, squash, and tobacco were brought to the old world. Large domestic animals like horses were brought to the new world and changed the nomadic lifestyle.\n3. The Europeans used their power to claim land by possesion of regions by the pope. They claimed they discovered the land and have conquered the poeple on it. They also claimed lands by occupying and improving them.",

How does internal tension in the Native American empires of the Americas aid Spanish attempts to create their empire?\n- The Spanish wanted to take over the natives land because of the wealth and happiness it could bring to them. Central and South America was rumored to have fortunes around the land.\n\n2. In the biological exchange between Europeans and Native Americans, what diseases, plants, and animals were exchanged? The diseases that Europeans brought over to the Americas were measles, smallpox and influenza. Domesticated animals, squash, beans, corn and tobacco were among the many things traded between the Native Americans and the Europeans.\n\n3. What are the ways that European powers claim their right to claim land in the Americas?\n- The pope authorized the Europeans to claim the land, claimed they discovered the land, and claiming they improved the land from the people they took it over from. \n",

Especially when the Aztecs even considered Cortez to be the God Quetzacoatl. They were easy to persuade and then to trick. He used them to take down the mighty civilizations and then Spain brutally turned on their own new allies to further conquer the Americas.\n\n**What racial system is established by the Spain in the new world? Why is it established and how does it operate?**\n1. Espanoles: Natural born Spaniards occupied the highest level of administration.\n2. Criolles: New-World born Spaniards they rivaled the Espanoles for wealth and opportunity.\n3. Mestizos: Mixed Spanish and Indian were like the middle class.\n4.Slaves/Indians: Lowest Rung\nThe Spaniards were outnumbered so they needed a way to incorporate Native Americans into colonial life even if it was terribly unequal. If you were \"pure-blood\" you had land and wealth in the colony. Half bloods and even Spaniards born in the New World were given much less than the pure bloods. They were middle class of the society, they did all of the work for little reward. Slaves and Indians had the very bottom rung of the society. They were eventually freed of the colonies so called slavery laws only to be forced into equally grueling work in a system of land-based forced labor.",

In addition to diseases, Europe introduced large domestic animals such as cattle and sheep, onions, turnips, citrus and other fruits, the honey bee, and my personal favorite, the coffee bean.  From America, the Europeans brought back things such as various veggies including corn, beans, and others higher in nutrition compared to their local agriculture, tobacco, the cacao bean, vanilla, turkeys, and various squashes.\n\n**What are the ways that European powers claim their right to claim land in the Americas?**\n\nThe Europeans claimed the land by the authority extended by the pope, claiming they discovered the land, and claiming that they had conquered the people of the land.

They really wanted to be on the top and have control over lands and people. They had religious goals that were to bring the people under their power, take over their land, and ultimately bring them to the Catholic church. They also had other goals that included having Central and South America under their control, to increase the power of Spain in World affairs, to seek out the gold and jewels that everyone thought were in the Americas to gratify their individuals ambitions of power and glory. They really just wanted to be the top dog over everything and everyone. \n\nIn the biological exchange between Europeans and Native Americans, what diseases, plants and animals were exchanged? The diseases that were brought over from the old world to the new world killed millions of Native Americans. Small pox spread through any human contact and was the biggest killer. Other diseases that were brought over were influenza and measles. The Native Americans had no immunity against these diseases like the other countries because they had never encountered them. The death toll was extremely high. They also exchanged large domesticated mammals. Horses were traded. They found corn, beans, squash, and potatoes that were more nutritious than wheat and rye. They also exchanged tobacco for smoking and chewing which became popular in Europe.\n\nWhat are the ways that European powers claim their right to claim land in the Americas? Authority was extended by the Pope to claim a large regions of land. They claimed they discovered the land, they claimed they conquered the people of the land, they claimed the land by occupying the land, and they claimed it by improving the land. ",

    "text": "**Week One: The New World**\n \n**Comment [1]**\n\n**When does American History Begin?**\n\nBefore 1492 and Columbus it suggests how deeply rooted our false notions of Native peoples were. It views them as unchanging and a primitive society. The idea that Native American societies changed only a little until Europeans arrived has only been seriously countered over the last few decades. \n\n**What was the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role does giving play in establishing status and obligation?**\n\nExchanges included, material good, marriage, resources, labor, ideas, techniques, religiousness practices\nExchanges sealed political and social relationships. Rather than accumulate materials wealth most would give it away to earn prestige and respect, this placed obligations on others to reciprocate \n\n**What developments occur in Europe that helped set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?**\n\nAll of European nations started to experience massive growth and population after the 15th century plague.\nPopulation growth brought the growth of national economies and rising demands for consumer goods.\nGrowing demand lead to the development of advances of ships building and navigation so that sea merchants could compete more effectively in expanding trade.\nThe resurgence of trade also lead to the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs who wanted to consolidate their power and increase their economic development of their nations.\nOnly powerful kingdoms could pull together the resources that were necessary to support large scaled voyages of exploration and trade. \nEuropean nations were fascinated and hungry for increase trade with the wealthy nations of Asia. \n\n**What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?**\n\nSlaves were not just an after thought in attempt to gain a place in the gold trade. There was an increase need for slave labor in the sugar plantation growth. The Portuguese traded with the Moors who were long established slaves suppliers. As the Portuguese traveled towards the Senegal River they discover that there were other Africans who engage in the slave trade. In the 1500 the Portuguese had turned themselves into a major slave purchaser and seller in West Africa. \n",

What impact did they have?**\n\nThere were three major crops; corn, beans, and squash, the so- called “three sisters” that provided nutritional needs necessary to sustain cities and civilizations. \n\n**What were the major differences between Native American and European people?**\n\nEuropeans had established communities where they lived and worked. Native Americans had settlements, but they were nomadic, following the game that sustained them. \nEuropeans were predominantly Christian, but Native Americans were more Deists, believing in the existence and powers of many spirits. \nThe music of Europeans was complex, using percussion, wind, and stringed instruments where Native Americans expressed music principally with drums. \nEuropeans obtained their food principally from farming and animal husbandry. While some Native Americans planted crops, many were \"hunter-gatherers\". \nEuropeans passed information along through writing. Native Americans passed information verbally and had no written language. They did use symbols for spirits that they held as being important. \n",

The Portuguese began growing sugar cane along the Mediterranean, but it was a difficult crop due to the growing conditions. The Portuguese found new land in the Atlantic Islands and Portugal’s would-be planters needed laborers to cultivate the difficult, labor-intensive crop. Portuguese merchants would trade guns, iron and manufactured goods for slaves who were owned by powerful African kingdoms, Slaves would work the sugar fields and began the first great Atlantic plantations. \n\n**What diseases devastate Native American peoples?**\n\nNative Americans lacked the immunities that Europeans and Africans had developed over centuries of deadly epidemics and so when Europeans arrived, carrying smallpox, typhus, influenza, diphtheria, measles, and hepatitis, plagues decimated native communities.\n",

Regarding the latter, it was to bring the land under Spanish control, increase Spanish power in world affairs, to acquire the great wealth rumored to be in the Americas, and finally on the individual level to advance politically and socially.\n\n2) The Spanish brought with them diseases from the Old World that people in the New World did not have immunity to. Greatest among these was smallpox, but also influenza and measles. Europeans introduced large domesticated mammals such as horses to the Americas and brought back with them new vegetables like corn, beans squash, and potatoes. Horses began to play a prominent role in the Great Planes with the Natives who resided there while tobacco from the Americas became a phenomenon in Europe and particularly Britain.\n\n3) Europeans claimed possession and authority over huge swaths of land from the Pope, the idea that they \"discovered\" the land in question, that they conquered the people in the land, occupying the land, and finally the notion that they were somehow \"improving\" the land, which I find odd given that so many Natives died due to their arrival.",

What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\nThey exchanged more than just materials such as; labor, techniques, ideas, and exchange of marriages for cultural values. The role of establishing status and obligation was for people to differ from one another, and to create special relationships in which someone would force another person to do something for him in a non aggressive way, by first giving him something of value.\n\n3.What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nFirst the population in Europe was massively growing. With the population high, labor increased and brought rise to national economies with a rising demand to consumer goods. With the demand high in Europe, it created a system for imports and exports from merchants that come from all over the world; thus creating an expanding trade. With the massive income gain, Monarchs rose fast and high. These Monarchs invested in explorers and trade to increase their gains.\n\n4)What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves?\n\nPortugal seeked the cheap labor of slaves to sell off to Europeans for sugar plantations. The Portuguese expanded their ideology of slavery across the world, meaning that Europeans learned this ideology and set it forth in the Americas.\n",

Sugar was very profitable and considered a luxury, but also was difficult to grow. The Portugese found new land that was able to support sugar production and with this discovery, they needed the manpower and labor force to grow it. Island natives were enslaved as soon as the Europeans arrived, but the Portugese, knowing slavery had already existed in Africa, widened the search and sought slaves from Africa.\n\n**What diseases devastate Native American peoples?**\n\n\tNative American were very unprepared for the arrival of the Europeans in so many ways, including protection from diseases that were brought over. The diseases that devasted the Native Americans were smallpox, typhus, influenza, diphtheria, measles and hepatitis. \n",

What are the variety of exchange that occurred in Native American societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\nNative Americans traded many physical and non-physical goods. The trading gave ideas and religion. For those people who became wealthy because of trading shared their ideas with people to help them become successful. This was the way the people began to start giving things back in return because they had help. \n\n3. What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nAfter dealing with the Bubonic plague which killed almost half of Europe's population. Economic growth came when the population growth began to rise and increased prices on consumer goods. People began to become rich off this because they made more money off selling to more areas than before.\n\n4. What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves?\n\nDue to the rise in sugar plantation, Portugal began to take a very high interest in slaves. By the 1500s the Portuguese were becoming very wealthy and helped expand slavery throughout the world.",

What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation? In addition to materials, labor, techniques, ideas, and exchange of marriages for cultural values. Giving was a way used to separate people from one another, and when you give somebody something, they are obligated to return the favor.\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? The black plague diminished half of the population in Europe, but once the population started to grow again, so did the economy. Trade became much more widespread with merchants coming from all over the world. \nWhat was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves? Portugal took interest in slaves when sugar plantations became more popular.Portugal would go all over Europe for slaves, and with the success of the sugar plantations, slavery spread over to America.\n",

Agriculture was rising quickly and these were the main staples for natives to survive on.\nThese crops allowed the people to create specific tools and techniques for sustainable farming. It brought social change, but caused a health decline in people.\nHowever, farmers were able to provide a lot more product than hunters giving room for more skills to develop among the community.\nOne specific difference that I noticed between Native Americans and European people is that one focused a lot on surviving and living. Unlike the Europeans the Native Americans were not obsessed with finding treasures. If they came upon it then they cherished it. Europeans took it for granted. Europeans may have been more advanced in some ways, but Native Americans were able to figure anything out in order to survive. ",

    "text": "1)Beans, corn, and squash were the three major crops developed in the Americas.  Corn was beneficial in the Native American lifestyle because of its longevity and versatile uses and ways of storage.  These crops also played a major part in the trade system.  In addition, it allowed farmers to produce more food than hunters, however these crops did not provide the proper nutritional needs, resulting in a decline in health.\n\n\n2)Native Americans and Europeans had very different views when it came to spiritual practices, beliefs on property, and kinship networks.  For example, European ancestry continued through the men in the family whereas in Native American culture ancestry was matriarchal.   \n",

What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\nNative American societies had exchanged a lot of their goods and material but they had also inhabited some of societies roles as a community. \nThe exchanges included their food, religious practices, languages, cultures, and marriages. They had also changed political relationships as well. In forming these relationships it brought two communities to adapt to each others life lessons. People were able to gain social relationships by earning each others trust and where they would gain respect amongst one another, and with those who were more wealthy were praised. With the wealthy giving more back to the villagers, it had brought a bond where people were to share favors amongst each other. \n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? \nWith the epidemic of the Plague, it had caused a large decrease of population. The remaining of the survivors had a higher demand on the goods. The high demand for trade brought people to explore of the resources, such as ships and maps to get around. The need for more things provided people with more money from selling items, causing many people to turn reach on the outbreak of the loss in society. \n\nWhat was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves? \nPortugal's interest in slaves because with the need in more supplies, it brought a higher demand for people to be at work. The Portuguese came into play in the trade of American slaves because they had brought what we now know in history as the slave trade. The Portuguese were known to be the middle man where they became the main seller and purchaser of slaves. ",

    "text": "When does American History begin?\n\nAmerican History began before Christopher Columbus sailed in 1492. The Native Americans existed before the arrival of the Europeans and are believed to have migrated from Asia about 20,000 years ago.\n\n\nWhat were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligations?\n\nExchanges included food, marriages, labor, religious practices, languages, cultures, ideas and techniques.  Political relationships were created as a result of these exchanges. Exchanges also sealed social relationships and those with more wealth gave some away to gain prestige and were thought of highly by others. In return, the giving placed an obligation to others to give back or give some other favor. Giving was a sign of a standing respect.\n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nEurope recovered from a deadly epidemic that wiped out nearly half of the population. What followed was a growing economy and a high demand for consumer goods. This demand led to advances to the development of ship building and navigation for trade expansion. In addition, the rising powerful monarchies wanted to consolidate power and increase their economic development of the countries. The European nations always pursued better ways to trade.\n\nWhat was Portugal’s interest in salves? What role does the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves? \n\nThey acquired slaves to work on their growing sugar plantations.  They traded with other people on slaves, as well as became middlemen of slave trade and expanded it across the world.\n",

    "text": "What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\nThe Native Americans exchanged material goods, marriages across community lines, resources, labor of ideas, techniques and religious practices. Exchanges sealed social and political relationships. It was done to earn prestige, where they would be thought highly of by the individual or group who had received the exchange, Also, by giving away things, it makes the other party obligated to give something back or do a favor. Exchanges also lead to respect in their eyes. \n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nFirst, there was a massive growth in population recovering from the plague of the fourteenth century killing half the population of the region. Second, population growth brought the growth of national economies and raised the demand for consumer goods. Third, this growth led to the development of advances of shipbuilding and navigation so that sea merchants could compete more effectively in expanding trade. Fourth, these trades led to the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs who wanted to consolidate their power and increase the economical development of their nation. \n\nWhat was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?\n\nWhen sugar demand increased, the Portuguese found interest in slaves because the demand for slaves increased. Once they figured out that slaves were high in demand, they took part in buying and selling them. By the 1500’s, the Portuguese made themselves both a major purchaser and seller of slaves in West Africa.\n",

When sharing knowledge you are respected and looked well upon. Also when you ask someone to teach you the ways of something you are obliged to tell or give them something. 2) Many people have set out to other countries for new land and exploration, In August 3rd Columbus  claims the new world for Spain and that the earth was round. Population growth not only replaced the dead from the Black Plague but increased national economy and demand for goods. The demands helped merchants and trade and advances in shipbuilding and navigation. All these advances led to smarter ruling by kingdoms and kings and queens conjoining lands to better help their nation, rise of power in kingdoms, increase economy and expanding trade. 3) Portugals interest in slaves were because slave labor have been scarce in Europe because of the Plagues.  Africans interacted with northern lands having Portugal be the middle men in selling and trading slaves. Then Africans were brought to Europe and new lands. ",

    "text": "1) The variety of exchanges that that occurred in Native American studies included material good, marriages between different communities, ideas, resources, labor, different techniques and even religious practices.  The status obligation that resulted from Native Americans giving up valuable possessions or similar goods played a huge part in the Native American community because it established a role of importance or high rank.  Giving up valuable possessions to others earned an individual prestige, respect, and to become highly thought of.  in addition, there was an obligation for those given to, to reciprocate those gestures.  By giving to others, they are obligated to owe you something back.\n\n\n2)The developments that helped set the foundation of european exploration and empire building consisted of several(somewhat dominoed) major events.  Following the recovery from the massive plague, there was a vast growth in the population.  The sudden increase in population growth led to a high demand for goods, which resulted in more ship building and a demand for more and more advanced ways of navigation for  more efficient competition.  This large system of trade led to large kingdoms and large monarchies being formed, and in return Spain was formed as well. With all of this, a desire for an increased trade with asia occurred, and an even larger expansion of trade.\n\n\n3)As the Portugese edged closer to the North western region of Africa, they realized the popularity of the slave trade. Slavery was already a trade in several regions of europe and even africa. With their expansive trade system, they took advantage of the opportunity to buy and sell slaves, expanding and changing the game of the slave trade.",

    "text": "When does American History begin?\n\nNative American history goes back approximately twelve to twenty thousand years ago where it’s believed that the first inhabitants may have come from Asia. From the time approximately after the last Ice Age, societies sprung up and thrived until Europeans came to their lands in 1492. That’s when Native American and American history collides and for the most part is referred to as American history from that point on.\n\nWhat were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies?\n\nThere were many varied forms of exchanges that occured in the confines of the Native American societies and groups. Material goods were often exchanged in order to help the other communities as well as labor, ideas and techniques. The further the distance of the exchanges, the more varied the differences would be between the groups conducting the exchange. This could mean more distinct differences in languages and cultures, but it didn’t prevent these alliances from happening.\n\nWhat role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\nMuch the way giving does now, when you give to a neighbor or neighboring community, those parties will feel obligated to help or give back to you or your community in some way. The more a person or community gave, the more respect gained in not only their community, but outside of their particular area as well.\n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nEurope had the benefit of a booming population and economy while on the mend from The Plague that decimated a lot of their country. With more people, more supplies and resources were needed. Resources were then needed from all areas, not just from Europe and this led to more shipbuilding and navigation technologies which would help supply all the needed resources from across the seas. The hierarchy in place was able to maintain this type of trading system while also trying to expand trade more and more and also upgrade their status as a trade country. This allowed Europe and European areas to open trades with Asian markets as they became known as wealthy partners.\n\nWhat was Portugal’s interest in slaves?\n\nThe slave trade was useful to Portugal as they had large sugar plantations that needed harvesting. Without enough of their own workers to properly and quickly do this, they relied on the slave labor force to ensure that this was could be done to keep up with their crop demands.\n\n\nWhat role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?\n\nAs Portugal became more and more heavily invested in the slave trade, other countries also noticed the rewards that this brought. Portugal became a “middle-man” of sorts and this allowed slavery to expand quickly beyond Portugal’s sugar crops",

What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n \nNative American society exchanged not only in the trade of material and goods but also in marries across community life.  In addition, it also exchanged the resources of labor and technique. For both individual and community, the exchanges sealed the social and relationship, network economic, political. \nThe giving played important role in getting respect from other people. For example, when you gave something to somebody you earned the respect and obligation from them, and they had to give you something back or they would give you a favor at another time.  \nEvidence in the wake up of the ices age suggested that band of two or three people traveled hundreds of mile to hunt and chase at favor camping side. After the ices age, community developed wider the range of food sources, they gathered food at specific region. Four thousand years ago, communities couldn’t exist on one place to get enough food and water. The growing culture allowed people to stop moving around and they could grow their own foods. People stopped worrying about the physiological needs and they started thinking about the world around them. \nFor example, Mississippian found a way to calculate accurate calendar by using wood, pillar stone, they looked at where shadow landing on the ground. The climate also decided what food available that affected what the culture looked like. \n\n3)\tWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\n-\tAll European nations were covering from a terrible epidemic of the plague which was killed nearly half of population of the region. \n-\tPopulation growth brought about the growth of national economic and widened the demand of consumer goods. \n-\tThis growing demand led to the development of advancement of shipping building and navigation.\n-\tThe development of trade set in motion the arrival of large Kingdoms who wanted to consolidate the power and increased the economic development of the nations. \n-\tOnly such powerful Kingdoms could pull together the resources that were necessary to support large scale.\n-\tThe European nations linked the trade with the wealth of Asia.\n\n4)\tWhat was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves? \n\nSlaves were second Portugal’s interest just after gold. Slavery had existed among African societies since middle 14th century, and it was grown when sugar plantations spread along the rim of Atlantic Ocean which increased the need for slave labor. Portuguese had turned themselves into both as role of the purchaser and seller slaves and kindly become middle man in trade slaves. They transformed the trade slaves around the world.\n\n",

    "text": "1. When does American History begin?\nAmerican History began before 1492 when Native Americans migrated to North America because of the Ice Age.\n2. What are the variety of exchange that occurred in Native American societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\nNative Americans traded many things both physical and non-physical. The people who became wealthy because of trading shared their ideas with people to help them become successful. In a sense it was them giving and the idea of giving was greatly respected.\n3. What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\nAlthough the Plague killed off most of the population, the population that survived seeked answers and caused consumer good prices to increase as well. This caused many more ways of things being traded because ships and navigation were starting to be used to get things around. People began to become rich since they made more money by selling to areas that were not sold to before.\n4. What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves?\nPortugal began to take a very high interest in slaves when sugar plantations increased. When the plantations were much more worldwide, the Portuguese started looking for more slaves near the Senegal River. By, 1500 the Portuguese not only found slaves for themselves, but help expand the slaves throughout the world as well.\n",

Those who gave were thought highly of, and also allowed others to feel obligated to return the favor or express their gratitude for their generosity in some other way.\n\n**What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?**\n* European population recovers from the plague in the 14th century that wiped out half of the region.\n* Population growth led to growth of national economies, which led to the rise in demand of goods\n* The demand of goods resulted in expanding trade through shipping, building and navigating.\n* The expansion of trade led to the rise of Kingdoms and powerful monarchs and allowed them to join their powers to increase economic development in their nations.\n* These powerful nations were able to gather their wealth and resources to support large voyages of exploration and trade\n* European nations looked for better routes of trade and exploration with wealthy nations of asia.\n\n**What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? **\n* Sugar plantations spread westward, leading to an increase in need for slave labor. \n\n**What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves?**\n\n* The Portugese became the middle men in the slave trade, buying and selling slaves.\n",

This was in a time when they used the regions they lived on to supply their needs.\n\n*** What was the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?***\n\nThe exchanges or trades that occurred were anything from material goods to natural resources, labor, and religious practices. Giving played a role by establishing obligation. The more one gave the more respect and power they had from individuals and community.\n\n***What developments occur in Europe that set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? ***\n\nEurope had just recovered from the plague that had killed half the population. As a result it  lead to a growing population, which then  resulted in a growing economy with a higher demand of goods. They developed easier ways to access goods and trades by ships and navigation. Trade lead to the rise of kingdoms that soon would be the easiest ay to demand foods and goods with effective routes of trade and transportation. \n\n***What was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?***\n\nThe Portuguese would buy slaves to do their labor work in harvesting their sugar crops. They soon began to buy and trade slaves with the Moors. Once they realized they were profiting trading slaves, they soon began to expand their business in slaves trade with everyone else. Portuguese soon became the highest slave purchaser and distributor making slave trade a common act globally.\n",

    "text": "**When does American History begin?**\nAmerican history began far before Columbus’ landing in 1492.  Native Americans existed and thrived in changing and developing societies, before the arrival of the Europeans.  American history most likely began with the migration of the first people from Asia between twelve and twenty thousand years ago.\n\n**What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies?**\nExchanges occurred with material goods, represented in marriages across community lines, resources, labor, ideas, techniques, and religious practices. Longer distances frequently crossed exchanges of cultural and language boundaries.  From casual to widespread alliances that were economical, political, and religious.\n\n**What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?**\nGiving placed an obligation to others to reciprocate for favors.  The more you gave gained you standing and respect by having others owe you.\n\n**What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?**\n* First all european nations began to experience massive growth of population, recovering from an epidemic of plague from the 14th century that killed 1/2 the population of the region. \n* Second, the population growth brought the growth of national economies, and rising demand of consumer goods. \n* Third, this growing demand brought the development of advances in ship building and navigation so sea merchants could compete more effectively in expanding trade. \n* Fourth, the resurgence of trade also led to the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs. They consolidated their power and increased the economic power of their nations. \n* Fifth, only these powerful nations could pool together their wealth and  resources that was necessary to support large scale voyages of exploration and trade. \n* Finally, these European nations sought better and more effective routes of trade and exploration with wealthy nations of Asia.\n\n**What was Portugal’s interest in slaves?**\nSlavery survived since the time of the Romans, especially in the growing of sugar. As sugar plantations spread westward, there was an increasing need for slave labor. The Portuguese traded with the Moors and discovered that as they traveled towards the Senegal river, other African peoples engaged in this slave trade with the Moors of North Africa.\n\n**What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?**\nWanting to initially control the gold trade and find a passage to the East, they essentially became middle men in the slave trade.  At the beginning of the 1500’s the Portuguese had turn themselves into both major purchasers and sellers of slaves in West Africa.  By entering into this trade, they transformed the slave trade and practice of slavery across the world.",

    "text": "1.) When does American history begin?\nTrue American history begins pre Christopher Columbus’s arrival on an island off the coast of the Bahamas in 1492, and in actuality begins with the core migration and settlement of native’s across the North American landscape as early as the first century. However, their more complex adaptation of the landscape and true societal origins begin to form around the 11th century.  \n\n2.) What was the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\nThe variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American societies was a direct result of the wide variety of social and cultural interactions that took place within the native people both in minute and grand scale; ranging from person to person or society to society. The exchanges themselves ranged from material goods to natural resources and labor, but also included marriage and the existential transference of ideas, techniques and religious practices. While the exchanges themselves took place in the form of causal encounters and widespread networks, they manifested across the spectrums of economic, political and religious impact; resulting in a broader absorption of the greater people because of the role giving played amongst these societies. Often, acquired wealth was given away in an effort to earn more prestige amongst your peers, in turn flipping the perception of financial prosperity from palpable wealth to generalized respect. This respect not only would establish an immense amount of status for an individual but would also allow that person to accumulate an immense amount of obligation as well, because as the wealth was given away the obligation was then placed on others to reciprocate the generous deed through favors instead of finance. This form of financial generosity led to this in-debt system, where people would owe favors instead of finances and assets, and status could be perceived by that persons withstanding in the community in terms of how many people ‘obliged’ to them. \n\n3.) What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nWith the onset of the 15th century, several developments occurred in Europe that set the stage for the foundation of European empire building and their interest in expanding exploration. First off, Europe as a whole experienced an inordinate amount of population stimulation and growth after the detrimental effect the Black plague of the 14th century had on the overall census. This uncanny population growth, however anticipated due to evolutionary generalized growth, led to an immense amount of fiscal growth amongst the greater European nations, and as the economies became more and more stimulated the demand for resources and consumer goods increased. These nations, to combat this growing demand, redirected their efforts and began investing their time and resources to furthering the development of shipbuilding and navigation to enable and improve sea merchants to compete within the ever-expanding trade networks across the globe. This resurgence of trade led to the growth of powerful kingdoms and powerful monarchs who had the ulterior motives of consolidating their powers and increasing their economic growth, for example: King Henry VII and the Tudor Dynasty in England and Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign in Spain. Only the powerful nations could pool together enough resources to fund large scale explorations in trade, and their undying fascination and hunger for increased trade with the immensely wealthy country of Asia began to drive the need for more effective routes of trade and transportation. This indirectly led to these countries building empires as the expanded their nation’s power across the globe as they sought the east, unintentionally opening up the unknown riches the rest of the world could provide to them. \n\n4.) What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves? \n\nEssentially Portugal’s motives indirectly began with the existence of slaves in Southern Europe in the mid 14th century where labor was scarce and the need for this forced later was extremely prevalent. With what began in the Roman Empire, sugar growing expanded into a popular form of agriculture amongst Europe as sugar plantations spread throughout the nation; from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, increasing the need for slave labor for a small country such as Portugal specifically. Originally, prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John the first, (of portugal) led expeditions to the west coast of Africa to control the gold trade and hopefully find new routes to the east. As the need for slave labor increased in the European nations, Portugal’s already engrained roots in the West African slave trade would allow them to initiate the Atlantic trade of African slaves, becoming a major player in the buying and selling of slaves, evolving into the middle men of this human commerce. Ultimately, Portugal’s integral role in the slave trade transformed the industry itself, but also carried the ramifications of revolutionizing the practice itself through the world expansions of the European powers. \n",

    "text": "1) When does American History begin?\n\n- American History began before 1492 when Native Americans migrated to North America because of the Ice Age.\n\n2) What are the variety of exchange that occurred in Native American societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\n- Native Americans traded many things. For example, physical and non-physical goods. The ideas of trading gave ideas and religion. For those people who became wealthy because of trading shared their ideas with people to help them become successful. This was the way the people began to start giving things back in return because they had help. There was a sense of respect for those who decided to give ideas and help others be successful during this era. \n\n3) What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\n- After dealing with the black plague which killed half of Europe's population. Economic growth came when the population growth began to rise and increased prices on consumer goods. This caused many more ways of things being traded because ships and navigation were starting to be used to get things around causing more places for the products to be sold at. People began to become rich off this because they made more money off selling to more areas than before. \n\n4) What was Portugal’s interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of American slaves?\n\n- Due to the rise in sugar plantation, Portugal began to take a very high interest in slaves. When the plantations took a more widespread in the world, the Portuguese started looking for more slaves near the Senegal River, where they could find more African slaves to work for them. By the time 1500 came around the Portuguese were becoming very wealthy and helped expand slavery throughout the world.",

    "text": "**When does American History Begin?**\nAmerican history began before Columbus' \"discovery\" in 1492, when Native Americans migrated to America.\n\n**What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?** Exchanges were made on a personal and more widespread level. Exchange does not just refer to physical materials, but also labor, ideas, and resources. Exchange was a heavy part of establishing personal and and community wide relationships, as it was capable of breaking language barriers and cultural differences, making a powerful form of communication. Those that accumulated wealth gave away much of their goods in order to gain the favor of their community. It also was used to create a sense of obligation to the recipients of the gift, so that they can later repay the favor.\n\n**What developments occur in Europe that set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?** Europe had just been recovering from the catastrophic plague that wiped out nearly half of their population, so they were in a time of expansion. This includes a growing population, which led to a growing national economy. The growing economy led to improvements in naval technology, which expanded trade within and outside Europe. Trade gave Europe the ability to develop monarchs and kings. These newly created Kingdoms were now healthy enough to explore foreign lands.\n\n**What was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?** Portugal had an expanding future in sugar crops, but lacked the labor to harvest them. The Portuguese initially traded slaves with the Moors, but soon found themselves trading with anyone. Portugal's involvement with slavery made it more common on a global level.",

For example, when you give something to somebody you earn the obligation from them, and they have to give something back or they’ll give you a favor at another time. \nEvidence suggest that in the wake up of the ices age, band of two or three people travel hundreds of mile to hunt and chase at favor camping side. After the ices age, variety of people develop wider range of food sources, they gather food at specific region. Four thousand yeas ago, communities couldn’t exist on one place to get enough food and water. The growing culture allow people to stop moving around and they can grow their own foods. People now stop worrying about the physiological need and they start thinking about the world around them. For example, Mississippian found a way to calculate accurate calendar using wood hand, still stone, they look at where shadow landing on the ground. The climate also decide what food available that affects what the culture looks like.\n\n3) What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n- All European nations were covering from a terrible epidemic of the plague which was kill nearly half of population of the region.\nPopulation grow brought the growth of national economic and widen the demand of consumer goods.\nThis growing demand bring up the development of advancement of shipping building and navigation result to the expand trade.\nThe results of trade also lead to the arrival of large Kingdom, powerful who want to consolidate the power and increase the economic development of the nation.\nOnly such powerful Kingdoms could pull together the resources that was necessary to support large scale.\nThe European nation fascinate by and create trade with the wealthy Asian and more effective well of trade and transportation.\n\n\n4) What was Portugal’s interest in slaves?

    "text": "1. What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\n\nBetween physical goods, non-physical goods were also exchanged from ideas and religion to even marriage. Long distance trades also met the mixing of language barriers and cultures which created networking and alliances. Those who established “wealth” that were knowledgeable in cultures and ideas would simply just share this knowledge with others. In giving knowledge to others, it created an obligation where if I gave you this, you would give me that. A favor for a favor in simple terms. \n\n2. What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\n\nAll European nations were beginning to see a surge in population growth due to the recovery of the 14th century plague. (It had killed off half the population.) Population growth also brought the growth of national economy and increased the demand for consumer goods. Since there were so many needs with the huge surge of population, this led to the advancement of shipbuilding and navigation resulting in an expansion of trades with more areas to trade in. With all of this put into play, large kingdoms with powerful monarchs began to rise up. \n\n3. What was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?\n\nPortugal was interested in the slave trade due to the rise of sugar plantations. Originally, the Portuguese had purchased slaves from the Moor as they were long time suppliers of slaves, but as the expansion kept spreading westward toward the Senegal River, other Africans had engaged in slave trade with them. By the 1500s, the Portuguese became buyers and sellers and essentially were the middleman. They were so involved that they became the core of slavery itself, greatly expanding it across the world.\n\n",

I am just a bit frustrated and sad now... :(\n\n This section intersting to me because I am part Native American . I come from the tribe Blackfoot. This tribe settled in the  Montana area. I am also part Portuguese so this was interesting even though I knew they were apart of the slave trade .. as were most countries.\n\n****1. When does American history begin? ****\nAmerican history begins before 1492 and Columbus right after the Ice Age  when Native Americans migrated into the Americas.\n\n**2.What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies?**\nSome of the exchanges that occurred included ideas, labor, food, techniques, goods and resources, cultures, marriages, language and dialect of languages. Also, they exchanged religion and political unions. \n\n**3.What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?**\nGiving to the Native Americans was very important. Giving happened no matter how rich or poor you were. Giving was a way of respect to them. By giving they earned prestige as many would think highly of those who gave to others.This also made the other person who you were giving to feel obligated to give something  or do a favor in return for the person's generosity.\n \n**4.What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European\n exploration and empire building?**\nDevelopments that occurred were growth in population and in the economy after the plague. This lead to a demand in many more resources and supplies. This then lead to the advancement in ship building and navigation to help with expanding trade across seas. At this time, kingdoms of hierarchy were created and the most powerful of kingdoms were able to hold up such a process of trade. Their goal was to expand their trade and gain better transportation also, to help with trading and eventually get to trade with Asian countries which they knew were wealthy.\n\n****5. What was Portugal's interest in slaves? ****\nPortugal's interest in slaves were to gain slave labor. Seeing that they could not get into  gold trade they needed people to manage and harvest in their sugar plantations that were expanding Westward.\n\n**6.What role do the Portuguese come to in the trade of African slaves?**\nThe Portuguese became major purchasers and sellers of slaves so their involvement became important to those in the slave trade.  They started off by trading slaves with the Moors and discovered that they were trading with other people as well. the Portuguese involvement then help slave trade expand across the world.",

    "text": "When does American history begin? American history really begins with the first Americans. The Native Americans that arrived when the ice age created a bridge between Asia and North America. When the glaciers melted, this bridge was no more. \n\nWhat were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies? What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation? The different exchanges that took place among the Native Americans were material goods, marriages between different communities, resources, labor, ideas, techniques, and religious practices. These took place over different cultures and languages, and they created alliances. The exchanges sealed social and political relationships, and they would then give away the possessions so they could earn respect, hierarchy, and so the other party owed them something. \n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? They were experiencing a population growth and were recovering from the epidemic of the plague. This brought the growth of economies and the need for consumer goods which led to the development of advances in ship building and navigations so the sea trade could expand. This trade led to the rise of large kingdoms and monarchs that wanted to consolidate their power and increase the economic development of their nations. Because of these large kingdoms, they were able to support the large scale voyages of exploration and trades because of their resources. The Europeans nations sought more effective ways of trade and transportation because of their desire to trade with the wealthy nations of Asia. \n\nWhat was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves? Slave labor had been known to go as far back as the Roman's for the need to grow sugar and there was an increasing need of slave labor as sugar plantations grew west and they wanted to gain a place in the gold trade. As they traded they became the middle man and traded slaves in West Africa and expanded it across the world. ",

These exchanges often sealed social and political relationships. It allowed the people who gave to earn prestige and placed an obligation to those they gave to. That was how the relationship was sealed. One person did a favor and the other must reciprocate. \n2. All European nations began experiencing massive population growth after the black plague, which increased the economy and the demand for consumer goods. These demands lead to advances like ship building so sea merchants were able to compete with their fellow merchants. Growing economies lead to bigger kingdoms and powerful monarchs. These kingdom's could pull together the resources needed for large voyages. European nations were also interested in trading with the wealthiest countries allowing them to seek  out the best trading routes. \n3. There was an increasing need for slaves and it had existed all the way back to the Roman Empire. The Portuguese became major purchasers and sellers of the slave trade allowing them to have influence on the way slave trading was done and the practice of it.",

With this in mind, small pox invaded the Incan Empire which made it easier for Francisco Pizzaro to seize the capital city. Epidemics were able to destroy half of the empires population and killing Huayna Capac which caused the war of succession. This allowed Pizzaro to take control.\nThe racial hierarchy was known as the Sistema de Castas. It was established to put different people into different categories to which these people in similar groups would each have their own level or perks. The order from the highest level to the lowest is Iberian-born Spaniards, New world born Spaniards and then at the lowest were the Mestizos.",

Whereas Europeans believed in property, Natives tended to believe in temporary ownership based upon who is *using* the land. Also, Natives tended to have no clear distinction between natural and supernatural, adopting sort of a pantheistic outlook on life whereas Europeans were mostly Christian. Also, Native kinship was matrilineal meaning based upon the mother whereas European was often patrilineal, based on the father.",

Exchanging increased your status as it obligated others to reciprocate, making it an effective political tool.\n\n2) Population growth following the plague, economic growth and a rising demand for goods, advances in ship building and navigation to expand trade, the rise of powerful leaders who wanted to consolidate their power, only powerful societies could afford to fund huge expeditions and voyages, and finally the greedy desire for better trade routes to Asia.\n\n3) The Portuguese's interest in slavery was due to sugar and the rise of plantations for that purpose. They greatly expanded African slavery and became the middle-man to the practice.",

People needs to be comfortable in order for him/her to feel safe. On the third level, a person must met \"Social Needs\". That's why a person cannot just live with his or herself because the need of love and family is essential. Everyone needs to feel an affection whether it is by friends or by family. The fourth level is \"Esteem Needs\", every person needs to feel respected because a positive feeling is a must with every person. Lastly, when a person met all the 4 levels of maslow's, there is \"Self Actualization Needs\" which is \"realizing full potential\". This one is important because this is where a person realizes all the experiences and learn by it. By satisfying all of these, an individual is considered complete and whole as a person.",

And about the teeth, when people eat meat more than vegetables and fruits, their teeth more stronger because teeth have experience to deal with meat that hard to chew. \nIn my opinion if they stopped agriculture and kept on hunting without breed them, a lot of animal would vanished, and food is very important for us as a fuel in our life. Agriculture such as vegetables and fruits have a good nutrition and vitamin for our body's needs. So it would be better if they didn't rely on hunters.",

The religious goals were to win people for Catholic church and the secular goals were to gain more power over the southern and northern america to have access to the wealth and gold.\n\n2) The greatest killer was the smallpox diseases that almost erased human life which was spread through direct human contact. Other diseases that killed Native Americans were influenza, malaria, whooping cough, diphtheria, and measles. European also brought in large domestic animals such as sheep, cattle, pig, and horse and plants e.g corn, avocado, squash, pineapple, peanuts, potatoes, etc which was more nutritious than the wheat, rice, barley and oats that the Native Americans were used to consuming. \n\n3) The Europeans claimed their right on claiming the land in America by the authority of the pope. Europeans also claimed to have conquered the native Americans and  discovered the land. They claimed possession by occupying the land. ",

    "text": "How does internal tension in the Native American empires of the Americas aid Spanish attempts to create their empire?\nSmall pox took out a lot of Native Americans during this time which weakened their empires drastically. The Incan empire was invaded with this disease which made it easier for Francisco Pizzaro to come in and seize the capital city. “But like the Aztecs, unrest between the Incas and conquered groups created tensions and left the empire vulnerable to foreigners. Smallpox spread in advance of Spanish conquerors and hit the Incan empire in 1525. Epidemics ravaged the population, cutting the empire’s population in half, killing the Incan emperor Huayna Capac and many members of his family and sparking a bloody war of succession.” With all of that happening, Francisco Pizzaro was able to deceive the Inca rulers and take control.\nWhat racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World? Why is it established and how does it operate?\nA racial hierarchy was marked in the New World in the mid-1600’s called Sistema de Castas. This system organized individuals into a variety of racial groups based on their “purity of blood.” It became almost prerequisites for social and political advancement in Spanish colonial society. Iberian-born Spaniards were at the highest level of administration and had the greatest estates. Below them are their descendants, which are New World-born Spaniards. Following them are the Mestizos, who were mixed Spanish and Indian heritage. ",

The same happened to the Incas, unrest between the Incas and conquered groups created tensions and left the empire vulnerable to foreigners. Smallpox spread in advance of Spanish conquerors and because of that Francisco inspired by Cortes took advantage of the chaos within the Incan empire and deceived the Incan rulers then took over the empire.\n\n\nThe system called the Sistema de Castas established by the Spanish in the New World, it was a racial system that organized individuals into various racial groups based on their \"purity of blood\". The system was established for prerequisites for social and political advancement in Spanish society. It gave people ranking in the society, Peninsulares—Iberian-born Spaniards, or Españoles had the highest levels of administration and acquired the greatest estates. Next in rank were their descendants, New World-born Spaniards, or criollos, had the next rung and rivaled the peninsulares for wealth and opportunity. Mestizos were those of mixed Spanish and Indian heritage followed. Slaves and Indians occupied the lowest rungs of the social ladder.\n",

They also wanted to gain wealth from the gold and gems in America. \n\n2)In the biological exchange between Europeans and Native Americans, what diseases, plants and animals were exchanged?\nDiseases were brought into the New World and killed many natives because they had no immunity to those diseases. Some examples of diseases brought in were smallpox, influenza, and measles. Plants such as Tobacco, Potatoes, Corn, Beans, Squash were also exchanged. Animals such as Horses were also brought to America and radically transformed how Native American cultures. \n\n3)What are the ways that European powers claim their right to claim land in the Americas?\nThey claimed the right of possession of the land saying that they were given authority and power by the pope. They also claimed that they were the one who discovered the land and conquered the people on the land. Also, they claimed possession of the land by improving and occupying the land. ",

Hernan Cortes was an example that captured and used the emperor Montezuma to gain control of the Aztecs' gold and silver which eventually branded the emperor as a traitor. This lead to the Montezuma's death. This behavior would be repeated by Francisco Pizzaro who would later decieved the Incan people to try to gain rule of the Spanish empire.\n\nQuestion 2: **What racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World? Why is it established and how does it operate?**\n\n- The \"Sistema De Castas\" was the system to be used by the New World that would organize people into racial groups according to \"purity of blood\". This was established to from a racial hierarchy. People with the purist Spanish blood in them would occupy the highest levels of administration along with the entitlement to certain rights.",

The Spanish quickly adapted  to the role of  authoritarian over the Americas. Their religious  goals were simple, to win all lands and the peoples for the Catholic religion. Their  secular aim included bringing central and south America under their control, and increasing  the power of Span in world  affairs. The Spanish came in search of great wealth, both in gold and gems that were rumored to be throughout America. This gratified their individual ambition for power and glory. Span was an especially stratified society and the Americas offered socially and political advancement.\n\nIn the biological  exchange between European and Native Americans, what diseases, plants and animals were exchanged?\n\nThe transfer of European diseases such as smallpox, influenza and measles had catastrophic repercussions which devastated the Native American population, other contributions  to the exchange were corn, bean, squash, potatoes and tobacco plants and  horses. \n\nWhat are the ways that European powers claim their rights to claim land in the America?\n\nThe Europeans ides of land ownership was established by a relentless legal system and the Pope, who believe their God commanded the land. These claims were orchestrated through force and conflict. The European took authority over the land with claims that they discovered, improved and where the rightful  owners.\n\nIn many cases, Europeans simply took the land that they wanted.  In other cases the Europeans co-existed on the land with the Natives only to make  future claims from outside settlers.\n\n\n",

    "text": "1.\t**What were the goals of the Spanish? (Individually and as a nation) in establishing an empire in Americas? **\n Spain’s religious goals were simple: to win these lands and people for the Catholic Church.  The secular aims included bringing Central America and South America under their control to increase the power of Spain and world affairs, to seek wealth both gold and gems that were rumored to be everywhere in the Americas, to gratify their individual ambitions for power and glory.  Spain was an especially stratified society and the Americas offered tempting opportunities for social and political advancement.\n \n**2.\tIn the biological exchange between Europeans and Native Americans, what diseases, plants, and animals were exchanged?**\n\nThe greatest killer (disease) was small pox which spread by direct human contact.  Other diseases that wreaked havoc on native communities included influenza (flu) and measles.  When Columbus landed on Hispaniola, the second largest island of the Antilles, lied east of Cuba, about 1 million people lived there.  Fifty years later, only 500 were still alive.  Even in the north where smaller Native American populations initially encountered only a few European explorers, traders, and fishermen.  Disease ravaged the countryside\n     The exchange of disease was only a part of the boarder mutual transfer of plants and animals that resulted from European voyagers of explorations, settlement, and conquest.\n     European introduced large domesticated mammals to the Americas.  They obtained from the new world a variety of vegetables, such as corn, beans, squash, and potatoes that were more nutritious than the old world wheat and rye.  The exchange of two other commodities significantly influenced two worlds.  In America, the Europeans discovered tobacco, a particularly significant plant in the establishment of the British colonies.  Tobacco for smoking and chewing quickly became a fad in Europe.\n     Horses brought to the Americas by Europeans radically transformed Native American cultures and were traded north through Mexico into the Great Planes where a variety of planes nations peoples adapted their nomadic lifestyles to include the animal.\n\n**3.\tWhat is sovereignty?**\nThe dictionary defines sovereignty as supremacy of authority or rule as exercised in a territory existing as an independent political entity.\n\n**4.\tWhat are the ways that European powers claim their right to claim land in the Americas?**\nThey claimed they claimed the right of possessions of these huge regions of land by authority extended by a pope.  They claimed their right of possession by claiming they discovered the land. They claimed their right of possession by claiming to have conquered the people on that land.  They claimed their right of possession by occupying their land.  And finally, they made these claims of possession by improving the land.  \n\n",

By giving things to others the Native American societies gained prestige and respect.\nThe development that occurred in Europe was the growing of population which is why the demand of merchants and ship building so they could transport more merchandise from and to other countries grew.  Another element than contributed to the growth of Europe was the union of two powers by the marriage of Fernando of Aragon and Isabella of Castille.  \n",

Portuguese merchants purchased slaves to work on the sugar fields and this is how the Atlantic plantations came to place. The Native American’s did not have the same immune system as the Europeans and Africans had. Because of this, the diseases that the Europeans carried killed off many Native Americans. These diseases were smallpox, typhus, influenza, diphtheria, measles, and hepatitis. The Native Americans body’s could not fight off these diseases since they have never been exposed to them, therefore 90 percent of their population had been killed off “within the first century and a half of the European contact.”",

You could not explore if you did not have the resources for voyages.\n\n3.  Slaves were in demand due to an increase in sugar plantations and scarce labor.

Once this act had been acquired, they would be obligated to return the same behavior.\n\nQuestion 2: **What developments occur in Europe that help set foundation for European exploration and empire building?**\n\n- All nations were beginning to experience a massive growth and population, rising economy (demand for consumer goods), ship building and navigation, the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs. Powerful kingdoms could pull together the resources that were necessary to support large scale voyages of exploration and trade.\n\nQuestion 3: **What was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African Slaves?**\n\n- Slavery had survived since the time of the Romans. Portugal had become known for producing sugar crops and eventually had sugar plantations growing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Islands, increasing their need for slaves. The Portuguese became the \"middle man\" in a trade of slaves in West Africa - expanding slavery across the world.",

    "text": "1) When does American history begin?\nNative Americans had their own culture, beliefs, and economies. Their society changed very little until the Europeans arrived.\n2) What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies?  What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?\nThe Native Americans exchanged a variety of things ranging from marriages to material goods. A couple examples of what they exchanged are resource, labor, ideas, techniques, and religious practices. Those who earned material possessions often gave it away to acquire a higher status in its society. It also gave the person who received the gift an obligation to give something back.\n3) What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building?\nAfter a massive plague, the European nations experienced a massive population growth in the 14th century. This brought growth in their Economies and rose the demand for consumer goods. This growing demand led to development of new technologies in ship building and navigation so that merchants can compete more effectively in expanding trade. The reestablishment of trade led to large kingdoms and thus increasing the economic development of those kingdoms. Also, because of the growth of these kingdoms, they can find all the resources necessary to support large scale exploration and trade. Finally, the European countries wanted to trade with the wealthy parts of Asia and therefore, with their new advancements, finding more effective ways to trade with them.\n4) What was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?\nPortugal used slave trade to gain a place in the gold trade. Also, labor became more and more scarce due to the plague, slaves were used as labor for sugar planting.  As sugar planting became more and more widespread in Europe, ranging from West Mediterranean to the Atlantic Islands, the demand for slaves increased. Due to this demand, the Portugese soon became a middleman for the slave trade. By the 1500s, the Portugese became a major seller and purchaser of slaves. They transformed the slave trade and the practice of slavery, making it much more widespread. ",

The variety of exchanges varied vastly. They ranged from resources to certain techniques, religious practices , also ideas and even marriages across community lines. For both parties these exchanges helped attain social and political relationships. people who gave away wealth knew that prestige and respect would come from it and it would force the people who accepted those gifts a obligation to do a favor for that person. \n\n3. First the European nations population were growing exponentially which led to a demand for consumer goods. The demand for consumer goods grew to the point that it led to the developments of new advances in ship building and navigation to expand in trade. And the surge of trade led to leaders wanting to increase the wealth of their nations. \n\n4. As sugar plantations grew the need for slaves also grew. In the beginning of the 1500's they became a big purchaser and seller of slaves in West Africa. They also played role in expanding the business of slaves across the world.",

    "text": "**What were the variety of exchanges that occurred in Native American Societies?** The variety of exchanges were material goods, resources, labor, ideas, techniques and religious practices. Also by spreading this exchanges, they created alliances, and network that were economic, political and religious.\n\n**What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?** Instead of keeping materials wealth, Native Americans did gave it away, in order to obtain respect and obligate these individuals or group who've received these goods to reciprocate this action, meaning that since they have received something, then they must return something.\n\n**What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation of European exploration and empire building?** It began when all Europeans nations experienced a massive growth in population after a terrible epidemic of plague that killed nearly half the population of the region in the 14 century. Because of the increase of population this led to a growth of national economies and rising demand for consumers’ goods. The raised demand of consumers goods led to the development of a more advanced construction of ships, buildings and navigation in order to be more effectively in expanding trade. Trade also led to the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs that wanted to consolidate their power and increase the economic development of their nations, and only powerful kingdoms could afford what was necessary to support a large scale voyages of exploration and trade.  Finally Europeans nations were so hungry in developing more trades that they sought better and more effective route of trade and transportation. \n\n**What was Portugal’s interest in slaves?** Portugal’s interest in slaves was the growth of sugar which they had learned from Muslims. The sugars plantations spread from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic island off the coast of Africa and therefore, there was an increasing need for slave labor. \n\n**What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?** The Portuguese became the major trader of slaves in West Africa. \n",

What role did giving play in establishing status and religion?\n\nThere were economic, political and religious exchanges. Exchanges would seal relationships with individuals or communities as opposed to accumulating material wealth. Those who accumulated wealth usually gave it away. This was done to earn prestige and to be thought of more highly by those who you gave something to. Also, those who received something were obligated to give something back to you later. \n\nWhat developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration building?\n\nThere was a substantial growth in population because of the destruction of that the plague caused in the fourteenth century. This led to the growth in economies as well as consumer demands which then led to the development and advances of ship building so merchants could compete for demands. After all of that, large kingdoms developed because monarchs wanted to increase their power and development of their nations. There nations were the only ones who could gather the resources to conduct such explorations.\n\nWhat was Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?\n\nAs sugar plantations spread toward the west there was an increasing need for slave labor. They traded with the Moors and realized that, as they moved toward the Senegal river, that slaves were a trade commodity. This made them major buyers and sellers in the slave trade. ",

    "text": "**1**. How does internal tension in the Native American empires of the Americas aid Spanish attempts to create their empire? *Because of the tension, the Incan empire was slowly coming to a close. The smallpox invaded their empire and the vast majority of the population was killed off, including the Incan empire, Huayna Capac and his family. Seeing this as an opportunity to seize the moment, Francisco Pizzaro moved south with 168 men and took control of the empire. Pizzaro seized the capital city, Cuzco, in 1533.*\n\n**2**. What racial system is established by the Spanish in the New World? Why is it established and how does it operate? *The racial system established by the Spanish in the world was based upon the \"purity of the blood\", organized by Sistema de Castas. It was established because of the prerequisites for social and political advancement in the Spanish colonial society. Peninsulares (Espanoles)-Iberian born Spainards. The descendants of the Peninsulares were the Criollos. They occupied the next rung and rivaled the Penninsulares for wealth and opportunity. The Mestizos was a term used to describe those of mixed Spanish and Indian heritage, that followed.*",

Having Sugar meant that you had money. The Portuguese started to grow sugar canes along the Mediterranean, but it was hard to maintain and grow.

They used violence while they explored land. Whilst the North American people lived in small communities amongst each other tied by kinship networks. The women had far more power under their belt, as they family was usually mainly from the females.

Most people who acquired this wealth gave it away, thus earning prestige and they were thought of highly by individual groups. They also gained respect.*\n\n**2**. What developments occur in Europe that help set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? \n*The developments that occurred in Europe that helped set the foundation for European exploration and empire building, was the growth in population that recovered from the plague from the 14th century, population growth brought the growth of national economies and rising demand for consumer goods, and the growing demand lead to ship building so that the merchants could compete for goods and profit whilst expanding trade, the trade also lead to the rise of large kingdoms and powerful monarchs, only big empires could pull together large scales of trades, and finally, the trades were commonly involved with Asia, which lead to transportation as well.*\n\n**3**. What were Portugal's interest in slaves? What role do the Portuguese come into play in the trade of African slaves? *Portugal's interest in slaves was because there was an increasing need for slave labor. By the 1500s, the Portuguese became the largest major purchaser and seller of slaves in West Africa.*",

What role did giving play in establishing status and obligation?**\nThe exchanges between Native American Societies was about trading goods, resources, marriages between two different community lines, different ideas, religious ideas. It expanded resources and alliances - both in political and religious perspectives. The role of exchanges established status and obligation, in a way that if your tribe was able to provide the most useful resources - you would be higher than others. Also, it gives the opportunity to establish obligation unto other communities if it was necessary.\n**2. What developments occur in Europe that helps set the foundation for European exploration and empire building? **\n1. Massive growth in population after the epidemic that killed half the population within the area. 2. With the population growth, there was a growth of economy and high demand of the necessities of living. 3. From the growing demand of goods, led to ship building and navigation so merchants could expand their variety with what they were able to trade. 4. Trade led to the establishment of higher regions, and also people who want to establish their own hierarchy in their own regions. 5. As monarchies were made, communities had gained the amounts of necessities allowing exploration, trade between farther regions as well as producing routes for transportation as well as trade. \n**3. What was Portugal's intent in slave? What role do the Portuguese come to play in the trade of African slaves?**\n\tAfrican slaves were around before Portugal had began using slaves, going back to Muslim using them during the crusade. Due to sugar plantations being grown from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, there was a growing need of labor. After seeing an exchange of slaves between their source and another slave trader, the Portuguese soon became another main source of slaves as well.",

The Europeans had established cities with bustling commerce, established trade routes both on land and sea. They had established governments, monarchies, that defined social status. The religion was also a powerful establishment that pretty much pervaded all of society. Whereas the Native Americans, while they did have cities and established civilizations, most often their communities were small by comparison. Often they were nomadic tribes and had different outlooks on religion, trade, possessions, relationships, and the very fact that they were indeed closer to the earth gave them a different outlook on life in general. For one thing, they were not as power hungry oriented nor was the accumulation of vast possesions their goals in life. They used the land and had their \"turfs\" so to speak, but they were not into the empirical conquest thing\". They believed in the Great Spirit in the sky, the same God of the Europeans, but some tribes had given over to the darker side of demonic worship and sacrifice. For the European who first landed in North America it must have been quite the culture shock, enough so that they came to call the Native Americans...savages.",

Eventually they became the biggest trader and supplier of slaves throughout the growing world.",
